Since we're not allowed to \"peek\" into the test set, we will implement the following simple treatment: We will assume that we don't know anything about unknown words and that in particular, their presence does not tell us anything about which class a document should be assigned to. Therefore, we will not include them in the calculation of the (log) probabilities during prediction, under the assumption that their probability does not differ hugely between the different classes (probably not a correct assumption, but the best we can do at this point).

This function should return a pair of NumPy matrices 𝑿, 𝒀, where 𝑿 is an 𝑁 × 𝐹 matrix (𝑁: number of data instances, 𝐹: number of features), and where 𝒀 is an 𝑁 × 2 matrix whose rows have one of two forms:<br><br>\n",

    "[0, 1] if the gold-standard class for the corresponding document is ‘nonoffensive’<br><br>\n",
    "This kind of representation is known as a one-hot encoding. You can read the first vector as saying that ‘there is a 100% chance that the instance belongs to the “offensive” class and a 0% chance that it belongs to the “nonoffensive” class’, and similarly for the second vector. Note that these are the two extreme cases for the conditional probability distribution P(k|x) for class k and feature vector x.<br><br>\n",

This index is built by the helper function `build_w2i()`.<br><br>\n",

The methods `p()` and `predict()` yield the probability of a class given an item, and the best class for the item, respectively. They can be implemented using appropriate NumPy matrix operations and the provided `softmax()` function. Note that you should set up both methods to take a whole matrix of input vectors as input, not just a single vector.<br><br>\n",

Typically, we shuffle the training data and split them into mini-batches (e.g, 100 items), then update the weights after each minibatch.
